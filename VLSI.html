							<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
								<DD><p>The purpose of this project was to design and implement three different multi-operand adders
								and to compare them against each other to determine which was the most efficient, based off 
								of the power, timing, and area results. These adders will be designed and implemented using 
								data path circuit design, standard cell based design flow, and design validation and verification 
								through the construction of Verilog programs. The adders will be synthesized using commercial EDA 
								tools from Synopsys and Cadence Design Systems.</p>
								
								<p>The first adder is simply a Carry Ripple adder which is the basic implementation of tying a series 
								of full adders together in a linear method and has the carry out of one full adder as an input to
								the next full adder. The second adder is a [3:2] Carry Save adder in a linear implementation. This 
								is similar to the carry ripple adder, but in this implementation the full adder does not need to wait 
								for the previous carry out bit to be calculated before it does its own calculation. The final adder 
								that was synthesised is a [4:2] Carry Save adder in a tree implementation which utilizes a lot fewer 
								adders than the linear implementations.</p></DD> <!--Add breif intro about [5:2] adder!-->
							</p>
							
							<p><h3>Background</h3>
							
								<p><DD><h4>Carry Ripple Adder</h4>
									A Carry Ripple Adder (CRA) or Carry Propagation Adder (CPA) is the basic implementation of a linear 
									set of full adder strung together to form a complete adder. A Full Adder takes three inputs, and 
									generates two outputs, a sum and a carry out. This can be seen below in Figure 1 [1].
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig1.JPG" width="50%">
									
									<p>
									In order to generate a full adder that took in multiple bit numbers, they were aligned so the Cout 
									of the first Full Adder was the Cin for the second, etc. This generates a single-bit Cout, and a 
									bit sum. Seen below in Figure 2 [1].
									</p>
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig2.JPG" width="50%">
									
									<p>Finally, the multiple bit full adders can be put together to form a complete multi-operand 
									addition. This can be seen below in a 4-operand example in Figure 3. (A,B,C,D,Sum are multi-bit, 
									and Ci and Co are just single-bit). </p>
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig3.JPG" width="25%">
									
									<p>This can be expanded to <i>p</i>-operands by continually adding a Multi-Bit Full Adder to the
									next level, and bringing in a new operand. In total, for 8-Operand addition there needs to be
									seven multi-bit full adders.</p>
									
								</DD></p>
								
								<p><DD><h4>[3:2] Linear Carry Save Adder</h4>
									<p>A [p:2] Carry Save Adder (CSA) is a way to take p bit-vectors and reduce them to just 2
									bit-vectors(VS, VC). After they are reduced to the 2 bit-vectors they can be put through a full
									adder to get the sum and the carry out. A [3:2] Carry Save Adder (CSA) is simply a modified full
									adder, in our case to take in three 7-bit numbers and return two 7-bit numbers. The CSA allows
									for the three bits to be added together through a full adder and to generate a VS, and a VC that
									carries twice the weight. That is it is shifted to the left one bit than the generated sum. The
									picture below in Figure 4 shows the implementation of a [3:2] CSA [2]. </p>
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig4.JPG" width="50%">
									
									<p>
									In our implementation of the [3:2] CSA, these adders will be put in a linear implementation. 
									That is the first three numbers are summed together to obtain VS, and VC. These outputs are 
									now the inputs for the next CSA along with the next number that needs to be added. After the 
									final CSA takes place, the results are then fed to a Carry Propagation Adder (CPA) to obtain 
									the Sum and Carry Bit; this can be seen below in Figure 5 [2].
									</p>
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig5.JPG" width="25%">
								</DD></p>
								
								
								<p><DD><h4>[4:2] Tree Carry Save Adder</h4>
									<p>
									A [4:2] CSA is simply a modified full adder, in our case to take in four 7-bit numbers and return 
									two 7-bit numbers. The CSA allows for the four bits to be added together through a full adder and 
									to generate a VS, and a VC. In a [4:2] CSA there are two levels to it. These levels implement the 
									[3:2] CSA, the first level takes 3 of the inputs, and generate the typical output for a [3:2] CSA.
									In the second level the fourth input is added to a sum from the previous level, and a carry from 
									the previous bit of the previous level. The picture below in Figure 6 shows the implementation of 
									a [4:2] CSA [2].</p>
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig6.JPG" width="50%">
									
									<p>
									In our implementation of the [4:2] CSA, these adders will be put in a tree implementation. That is 
									the first four numbers are summed together to obtain VS, and VC. And the last four number are summed
									together to obtain VS, and VC. The two sets of VS and VC then are inputted into a third [4:2] CSA on 
									the second level. After the final CSA takes place, the results are then fed to a Carry Propagation Adder 
									(CPA) to obtain the Sum and Carry Bit; this can be seen below in Figure 7 [2].
									</p>
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig7.JPG" width="40%">
								
								</DD></p>
								
								
								<p><DD><h4>[5:2] Tree Carry Save Adder</h4>
									<p>
									The [5:2] CSA was used to implement 10-operand addition. This was done utilizing a [5:2] 
									CSA, as seen in the Figure 8 below [2].
									</p>
									
									<img src="projects/429/Figures/Fig8.JPG" width="50%">
								
									<p>
									The [5:2] adder was very similar to the other CSA, with this implementation it had three 
									levels of multi-bit full adder described earlier in the report. Utilizing these Carry Outs
									of each level could be manipulated to become Carry Inputs for the other levels of Full Adders.
									As seen in the figure above. The first level of full adders takes in the first three operands and 
									generates a sum and carry, the sum is fed directly to the next level, and the carry is sent to the 
									input of the third level full adder but shifted to the left by one. The second level takes the sum 
									from the first level, and the other two operands. This generates another sum and carry. The sum is 
									sent to the input of the third level full adder, and the carry is sent to the input of the third 
									level full adder but shifted to the left by one. Finally the third level takes in the sum from 
									level two, and the two carries from the level one and level two from the right section. 
									This final level generates the VS and VC that can then be inputted into a simple CPA to
									generate the sum and carry out.
									</p>
									
									<p>
									In order to account for all the 10 operands, a tree structure where the first 5 operands are 
									inputted into a [5:2] CSA, and the last five operands are inputted into another [5:2] CSA. The 
									4 total outputs of the [5:2] (VS1, VC1, VS2, VC2) are then inputted into a [4:2] CSA to generate 
									VS3 and VC3. These outputs are then inputted into a CPA where the Ci could then be factored in. 
									This generates the single bit Cout and the multi-bit Sum. This implementation of 10-operand 
									addition can be seen below in Figure 9.

							<p><h3>Functional Validation and Verification</h3>
								<p><DD>
								In order to ensure proper functionality throughout the design process of our 8 operand adders, 
								we employed different verification techniques. First, the original verilog code for each adder 
								was tested using a test bench. The test bench simulated several different input combinations 
								to verify that the code produced the correct sum for input values between 0 and 15 for each 
								perand. In addition, the carry-in and carry-out bits were tested by running a simulation with 
								a carry-in value of 1 and a simulation with a sum of 128 respectively. Having a sum of 128
								verifies the carry-out bit because the sum output is only 7 bits long and 128 is an 8 bit number. 
								The list of simulations run can be seen in the Table below. </p>
								
								<img src="projects/429/Figures/T1.JPG" width="100%">
								
								<p>This test bench outlined above was used to verify each of the three different designs, 
								thus ensuring that the carry ripple adder, [3:2] linear, and [4:2] tree adder produced the same 
								results as can be seen in the Table below.</p>
								
								<p>Validation after gate level synthesis (.vh file), and placement and routing (final.v file) 
								was achieved by using the same test bench as the original code. This allowed us to check 
								the results of the simulations in two different ways. We could verify that each simulation gave 
								correct sum and we could compare the results to those obtained from the test bench of the original 
								code.</p>
								
								<p>Although using the test bench shows proper functionality during different steps of the design process, 
								in order to guarantee the correctness of our models, we must use formal equivalence checking. To do this 
								we use Synopsys Formality. This software can verify the original verilog code to the standard cell layout 
								that has been synthesized and optimized [3].</p>	
								
								<img src="projects/429/Figures/T2.JPG" width="100%">
								
								<p>Since the [5:2] adder took the sum of 10-operands instead of just 8 a different set of conditions 
								were tested. They took on the same testing principles as stated above. Below is a Table that sumerizes
								the 10-operand addition. </p>
								
								<img src="projects/429/Figures/T3.JPG" width="100%">

							<p><h3>Synthesis Results</h3>
								<p><DD>
								The carry ripple adder, 3:2 linear, and 4:2 tree adder were synthesized using the same design process. 
								First, the preliminary verilog code was created using structure verilog code. Structural verilog code allowed 
								us to easily follow the execution of the code and debug possible errors.
								</p>
								<p>Next, the verilog code was synthesized into standard cells. This process was completed using Synopsys Design 
								Compiler [3]. The compiler requires two pieces of information into order to properly function: the verilog code 
								to be synthesized and specifications for the synthesis. The specification file from lab 9 was used with minor 
								modifications. The list of verilog files was modified to include our code to be synthesized and the clock was 
								changed to 250 MHz as specified in the project descriptions. The output of the compiler is a gate level netlist 
								of the interconnected standard cells saved as a .vh file.
								</p>
								<p>After creating the netlist of standard cells, we need to lay them out and connect them. Since the dimensions, 
								timing, and power consumption for all standard cells are known, we can use that information to optimally place 
								each cell and connect it to the other cells. This process is completed using Encounter [3]. As with the Design 
								Compiler, Encounter requires two pieces of information: the gate level netlist to be laid out and a template file. 
								The template file used was the same one used for lab 9. It contains information regarding the placement and 
								routing of the cells. We modified it to include the netlist obtained from the Design Compiler. Encounter 
								produces a GDSII file (final.gds2) which contains the optimized cell layout, an equivalent verilog model 
								(final.v) of the circuit, and many files regarding timing and power. The GDSII file is used for the final 
								layout design and the verilog model is used for verification. The timing and power files are used for 
								comparison and analysis.
								</p>
								<p>At this stage we had all the information necessary to analyze the three different adder designs. 
								In order to accurately compare the different designs we looked at three different factors: timing, power, 
								and size. All these factors are important to chip design because we wish to have the fastest logic 
								possible for the lowest price and the lowest power consumption. Using the information output by Encounter 
								after the placement and routing of the standard cells, we were able to determine the size of each design, 
								the power consumption, and the propagation delay. The results are shown below in the Table.
								</p>
								
								<img src="projects/429/Figures/T4.JPG" width="100%">
								
								<p>The carry ripple adder is by far the slowest design out of the three. This is because the carry-out 
								is propagated from one bit to the next, thus sum of the current bit has to be completed before he sum of 
								the next bit can start. The linear adder and tree adder, however, are much faster because the carry is 
								saved instead of propagated. The tree adder is faster than the linear adder because it has 2 fewer levels; 
								the tree adder has 4 levels and the final addition, whereas the linear adder has 6 levels and the final addition.
								</p>
								
								<p>The size of the designs is determined by the number of standard cells required to construct it. 
								Again, the carry ripple adder is much larger than the other two. The propagation of the carry-out requires 
								there to be more internal adders, thus increasing the size. The linear adder and the tree adder are much more 
								comparable due to carry saving. The tree adder is slightly smaller due to the fewer levels required to implement 
								it.
								</p>
								
								<p>The power consumption is related to the number of transistors required for each design. As previously discussed, 
								the carry ripple adder is much larger meaning it has more transistors. Since it has more transistors, the carry ripple 
								adder will have a larger power requirement. However, the linear adder and tree adder have similar sizes but the tree 
								adder consumes almost half the power. This is due to the activity factor of the transistors. The activity factor of 
								the tree adder transistors is likely to be lower than those of the linear adder, resulting in a lower power requirement.
								</p>
								
								<p>Comparing the three designs as a whole it is clear that the tree adder is a much better design because it is smaller, 
								faster, and has lower power requirements than the others.
								</p>

								<p>Finally, we need to complete the layout design. The GDSII file produced by Encounter contains the layout of the placement 
								and routing of the standard cells, but it does not contain the individual cell layouts. To incorporate the individual layouts 
								into the placement layout, we use Virtuoso [3]. Virtuoso accepts the GDSII file as an input stream and uses a standard cell 
								library to import the layouts of the standard cells. The resulting layout design for the carry ripple adder, linear adder, 
								and tree adder can be seen in figures the figures below.
								</p>

								</DD></p>
							
							<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p><DD>
								Three different 4-bit, 8 operand adders were designed as part of this project: a carry ripple adder, 
								a [3:2] linear adder, and a [4:2] tree adder. The same design process was used for all three. First, 
								the verilog code was written. Then, the code was synthesized into a netlist of standard cells using 
								Synopsys Design Compiler. After that, the layout of the placement and routing of the standard cells was 
								created using Encounter. Finally, the individual standard cell layouts were added to the layout of the 
								placement of the cells using Virtuoso.
								</p>
								
								<p>Throughout the design process, the results were validated using a verilog test bench. The test bench
								simulated several input combinations for the adders so they could be verified to be operating correctly 
								for all input cases. The same test bench was used for all three designs and at each stage in the process 
								so the results could be compared to ensure proper functionality. Additionally, once the placement and routing 
								was completed, Synopsys Formality was used to formally verify that the interconnected cell layout was equivalent 
								to the original verilog code.
								</p>
								
								<p>Once the design was complete, it was found that the [4:2] tree adder was the most ideal out of the tree 
								designs. It was the smallest, the fastest, and had the lowest power requirements of all three designs. This 
								is due to the fact that the carry ripple adder uses carry propagation, greatly slowing down the logic operation, 
								and the [3:2] linear adder had more levels, requiring more space and more power.
								</p>	
								<p>In addition to the three 4-bit, 8 operand adders, one 4-bit, 10 operand adder was also designed. This adder 
								used two [5:2] carry save adders and one [4:2] carry save adder in a tree format. This adder was designed using 
								verilog code and was tested using a new test bench that implemented two extra operands. The verilog code was 
								tested to be fully functional, however it was designed as a proof of concept and the layout was not synthesized.
