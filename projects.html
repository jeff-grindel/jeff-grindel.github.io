							<p>Sous-Vide is a method of cooking food in a sealed plastic bag in a 
								water bath for a longer period of time. The water bath needs to be 
								at a constant temperature (around 125 °F to 140 °F) for a long period 
								of time in order to cook the food evenly.

							</p>

							<p>Instead of buying one off the shelf, I decided to do it using my Arduino Uno
							Microcontroller, an LCD screen, a temperature probe, an AC power switch, a crockpot
							and some crafty coding. Check out the link below to see more.

						<legend><a id="Micro">Simple CISC OS</a></legend>
						<p>During my junior year at Illinois Tech, I took a Microcomputers class that focused on the design and implementation of the Motorola 68000 Microprocessor. 
						Throughout the year we did labs that focused on exception handling and processing, memory design using RAM, Input/Output Design, Parallel Interfacing Using the 
						PIA, and finally Serial Communication using the ACIA. During these labs we were mainly using a Monitor Program that was installed on these microprocessors to 
						perform basic commands that helped us implement the labs. Our final project was to build our own monitor program to perform the basic commands that the one in 
						class used. Our program needed to perform basic debugger functions, such as memory display, memory sort, memory change, block fill, block search, and block move. 
						On top of implementing these instructions our program also needed to be able to deal with exceptions, my monitor OS was programmed to deal with Bus Errors, Address 
						Errors, Illegal Instructions Privilege Violations, Divide by Zero, Line A and Line F Emulators, and CHK Instruction exceptions. Check out the link below for a more 
						detailed write up. (I am considering this a simple Operating System, since it is based on user interface).

						<legend><a id="Processor">32-Bit MIPS Processor</a></legend>
						<p>In my Computer Organization and Design our final project was to construct a 32-bit MIPS processor that implemented a limited amount of instructions, such as add, 
						jump, branch, logic or, load word, and store word. The entire processor was simulated using VHDL and ModelSim to compile and test the program. The overall processor 
						was split into sub components so it was easier to test and combine them when they worked. The processor mainly implemented the datapath side of the processor and did 
						not have a dedicated control path to send control signals to the various building blocks. The controls signals were mixed into the datapath, and can be seen in orange 
						in the overall diagram below.

						<legend><a id="VLSI">VLSI Adder Synthesis</a></legend>
						<p>In my Introduction to VLSI Design final project, our task was to implement three different 8 
						operand adders in Verilog and synthesis them automatically using Encounter. The first adder was 
						simply a carry ripple adder, the second adder was a [3:2] Compressor adder in a linear implementation, 
						and the final adder was a [4:2] compressor adder in a tree implementation. As part of a bonus part of our assignment
						10 operand adder was to be implmented using a [5:2] compressor adder in a tree implementation that also was 
						optimized by having a [4:2] adder as the second stage. This 10 operand adder was not synthesised and was just
						written in Verilog and tested with a benchmark to ensure that it was working.

						<legend><a id="D3L">Data Driven Adders</a></legend>
							<p>
							For my Advanced VLSI Design class we looked into more recent circuit technologies from IEEE publications. For 
							our final project we were to implment two related circuit techniques both being data driven. The full adders were implmented
							using Data Driven Dynamic Logic (D3L) and Split-Path Data Driven Dynamic Logic (SPD3L). For each circuit technique three different
							booleon expressions for the Sum and Carry were used for a total of 6 different 1-bit adders that were then put together
							to produce 6 different 4-bit adders. After the construction of the circuit schematics were done, they were all run through 
							power, leakage, and delay analysis.

							<p>
							For my Computer Simulation class throughout the year we worked on a C++ program to act as a compiler/simulator for a
							simplified version of VHDL or Verilog. The project was split up into four steps; The first was Lexical Analysis where we 
							converted a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens, something easier for a program to inturppet. The second part was
							the syntactic anylsis where the tokens were anylsised for the corect syntax defined by the simflified HDL. Third was the construction
							of netlists. And finally the last part was the simulation of the netlists.

						<legend><a id="Ipro2">Engineering Solutions</a></legend>
						<p>A group of IIT students during the Fall of 2012 worked closely with OMRON Automotive Electronics Inc. OMRON is an international manufacturer of electronic devices 
						used in the Automotive Industry. The team was tasked with two problem statements, one being the development of process improvement of a new manufacturing line, and the 
						other being an issue with the consolidation of workbenches and processes to reduce the floor space.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						The team split these two projects between the students. I was a member of the "Mixed Model Line" team tasked to reduce the floor space. During the semester we learned 
						a lot about manufacturing processes, different product lines, and lean manufacturing. From our work during the semester the IPRO was awarded the following awards at 
						the school competition held at the end of the semester.

						<legend><a id="Ipro1">Polar Power</a></legend>
						<p>A group of students at IIT got together and worked closely with the McGill Arctic Research Station in the Canadian High Arctic to design, build, and install a wind turbine 
						generating system. The purpose of this wind turbine generating system was to provide power during the winter months to the remote site when it was not occupied and when other 
						forms of alternative energy, such as solar, were not possible.</p>

						<p>Throughout the year we were in contact with the research team to try to gather as much wind data that was possible. During this process, I was charge in writing a program to 
						read and interpret the data. I implemented this using a Java program that took in the different data we got from various wind agencies. The data that we got was usually very crude 
						but a similar format was used by them all where they had a pretty steady stream of reading all year long, every day of every hour. Using this I was able to determine which month was 
						the highest and lowest production of usable wind, the amount of time our proposed wind turbine was going to be operational (in order for our proposed wind turbine to run there was a 
						start up speed of 5mph. It was from this data that the group determined either we needed to install our own installation of wind monitoring devices at the actual location of the 
						proposed site or to take the data from the surrounding area and determine that wind generation in the arctic circle was not a viable option.
						Unfortunately, after analysis of wind data and geographical surveys, it was deemed that it would not be economical to install a wind generating station at this remote site.
