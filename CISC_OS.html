							<p>This implementation of the CISC operating system is to implement a very limited number
							of instructions and exceptions. The main purpose of this is to interact with the user in order
							to run/debug assembly code written by the user. This specific implementation was written using 
							the Easy68K simulation software since the Motorola Processors were in the lab and was not always
							accessible. This simulation software utilizes different TRAP functions than the typical CISC implementation 
							therefore will not be able to be directly loaded onto the 68K processor. Instead, simulation will need to be 
							run using Easy68K.</p>

							<p><h3>Design</h3></p>
							<p><DD><h4>Command interpreter</h4>
							<li>Input/Output interaction with the user</li>
							<li>Prompt user to enter various commands</li>
							<li>Command recognized, implements subroutine</li>
							<li>Command not recognized, prompts user to enter another command</li>
							<!--Insert the Flowchart -->
							<h4>Debugger Commands</h4>
							<p>The following commands are the supported commands written into the program with the Command name, 
							the Description of the commands, and the proper syntax of the command. Generally '$' Indicates a hexadecimal 
							number, '#' indicates a decimal number, 'XX' indicates the specified number in proper form, and 'STRING' 
							is a string of characters. After each command in entered into the command prompt press enter to run the command.</p>

							<h4>Exception Handling</h4>
							<p>In the program, the following exceptions will be caught during runtime. When an exception
							occurs the register values are saved to the stack and then outputted to the terminal
							for debugging purposes. </p>
							<li>Bus Error Exception</li>
							<li>Address Error Exception</li>
							<li>Illegal Instruction Exception</li>
							<li>Divide by 0 Exception</li>
							<li>Privilege Violation Exception</li>
							<li>Line A Exception</li>
							<li>Line F Exception</li>
							<li>CHK Error Exception</li>
							
							<h4>Instruction Manual</h4>
							<p>The Instruction Manual is simple the HELP command that can be seen in the Debugger Commands Table. This allows the user to input the HELP command 
							to print out the implementation of the debugger commands.</p>
							</DD></p>
							
							<p><h3>Implementation</h3></p>
							<DD><p>In order to have the program organized the code is separated into various sections. This was necessary because 
							the amount of code written needs to be organized. The main sections of the program include:
							<li>Memory Reservations</li>
							<li>Main Program
							<li>Buffer Call Subroutines
							<li>Table Lookup
							<li>Command Execution
							<li>Output messages
							<li>Command Subroutines
							<li>Conversion Subroutines
							<li>Checking Subroutines
							<li>Exception Handling</li>
							<p>The memory reservations are where all of the necessary reservations are made. These include the help menu, 
							input buffer, command tables, temporary buffers, and messages that will be called in the output message sections.</p>
							<p>The main program simply outputs the terminal prompt and prompts the user for input. After this is done they branch 
							to the necessary commands. Once done the subroutines return back to this main program and the process is repeated indefinably.</p>
							<p>The buffer call subroutines are where the program outputs the terminal prompt and takes in the input from the user. If does various
							checks to see if it is viable input. It will then call the table lookup.</p>
							<p>In table lookup, the command entered in the buffer call section is checked against a list stores in the memory reservations section. 
							This is to verify if the command entered is a command that is recognized by the program. If the command is not found in the table 
							then an error message is printed and the program returns back to the main program.</p>
							<p>The command execution takes the data from the table lookup and will determine where to branch to base on the command entered into the program.</p>
							<p>Output messages are a majority of the subroutines that are called from various other routines for outputting a message to the terminal.
							These messages include a couple error messages, hex to decimal output message, decimal to hex output message, block found message, block 
							not found message, and sort message.</p>
							<p>All twelve of the debugger commands are located in the command subroutines section. This is a bulk of the code because there is a lot of 
							checking to do and the actual commands are executed here, and no two subroutines are the same.</p>
							<p>The conversion subroutines are used in various command subroutines. Since the user enters input in the terminal in ASCII format there is 
							an ASCII to binary conversion and ASCII to decimal conversion. Since the terminal needs to print out messages the hex values that are mainly 
							used in the subroutines must be then converted back to ASCII in order to be displayed in the terminal, these are Hex to ASCII. There is a final 
							Decimal to hex routine that is used in the CON2 command.</p>
							<p>Each subroutine has different arguments so there has to be a way to check if all of these inputs are correct. The checking subroutines are called 
							throughout other subroutines. The checking subroutines include checking for hexadecimal input, decimal input, space, ‘$’ check, ‘#’ check, a routine 
							that calls all of these, and finally a routine that checks if an address is located within the program space ($1000-$3FFF).</p>
							<p>Finally we have the exception handling subroutines. This is where all of the exceptions are caught and the contents of the registers are displayed.</p>
							</DD></p>
